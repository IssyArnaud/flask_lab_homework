#### tried a bunch of things here to get some way of generating an order number via functions
#### this was part of an idea for how to get the links from the order list page to go to individual orders



# from order import Order

# order_01 = Order("Beatrice Lofthouse", "01/09/2023", "kimchi", 1)
# order_02 = Order("Benji Marshall", "03/09/2023", "beef jerky", 3)
# order_03 = Order("Stella Gavey", "05/09/2023", "sourdough starter", 2)
# orders = [order_01, order_02, order_03]

# print(order_01.order_number)
# number = order_01.assign_order_number
# print(number)
# print(order_01.order_number)

# print(order_01.order_number)
# number = order_01.assign_order_number(50)
# print(number)
# print(order_01.order_number)

# number = order_01.return_index_position
# print(number)
